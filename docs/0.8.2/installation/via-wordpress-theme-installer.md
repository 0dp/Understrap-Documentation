## Standard WordPress Theme Installation

You can install UnderStrap just like any other theme from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/themes/understrap/){:target="_blank"}. This means you can install it from your WordPressÂ´ backend just like any other theme.

### Installation from WordPress Theme Directory

Visit *Appearance* &rArr; *Themes* &rArr; *Add New Theme* and search for "*UnderStrap*".

You have the choice to preview UnderStrap in a standard setup without installing it or directly install and activate it when the installation is finished.

### Installation by Uploading

If you prefer to install the Github-hosted version or have problems using the Installer from the WordPress Theme Directory you may also choose to upload a .zip- file.
Get your Download either from the [WordPress Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/understrap/){:target="_blank"} or the [UnderStrap Github Repository](https://github.com/understrap/understrap){:target="_blank"}.

Visit *Appearance* &rArr; *Themes* &rArr; *Add New Theme* &rArr; *Upload Theme* (on top next to the headline).<br>
Select the previously stored .zip file from your HDD and click *Install now*.
{: .p-3 .text-white .bg-dark}

As soon as the upload is finished you may choose to *Live Preview* or *Activate* your uploaded theme.

**IMPORTANT**: If you download UnderStrap from GitHub make sure you rename the `understrap-master.zip` file to `understrap.zip` or to rename the uncompressed folder to `understrap`.

Otherwise you might run into problems updating the theme or using child themes.
